## Intro

Interview quiz - React application. 


## Getting Started

First install libraries from package.json:

```sh
git clone <repo-url>
npm install (in both the \WEB_NODEJS\ folder and the \WEB_REACTJS\ folders)
```

Once it's installed, you can run `npm start` in WEB_REACTJS to run the react application and it will run the development server on your local machine, and give you a URL to browse.


## Dev Tools 

Edit, build and debug with ease

> VS Code Extension
* Eclipse key map
* MDX Extension
* Git lens

> Chrome Extension
* React dev tools


## Best Practices

* Application builds on - `feature based` pattern
* `ATOMIC` - To design component
* Styling - `SCSS` CSS pre-processor 
* Images - `SVGR (Scalable Vector Graphics React)`
* `kebab-Case` for contants variables

### Development scripts

**Note:** Run the following commands in the \WEB_REACTJS\ folder to see the results.

##### `npm start`

> it will run the development server on your local machine

##### `npm test`

> boolean check if unit tests all pass - uses jest and enzyme

##### `npm run storybook`

> it will run the development server on your local machine, and give you a URL to browse some sample stories.


### To Start Backend

**Note:** Run the following command in the \WEB_NODEJS\ folder to see the results.

##### `npm start`

> it will run the development server on your local machine


## Code-splitting 

`Code-splitting` with React. It's a process of taking one large bundle containing your entire app and splitting them up into multiple smaller bundles that contain separate parts of your app.
